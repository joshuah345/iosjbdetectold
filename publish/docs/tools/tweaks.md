# Tweaks

These tools attempt to circumvent detection methods.

!> Do not attempt to use multiple bypasses at once. It will result in conflicts and apps are very likely to crash if you do.

?> libhooker (Taurine, Odyssey, etc.) users: Bypasses seem to crash apps on libhooker 1.6.3 (latest stable version). Try updating to libhooker 1.6.9b2 from [libhooker beta repo](https://sharerepo.stkc.win/?repo=https://repo.theodyssey.dev/libhooker-beta) if this is the case for you.

?> For further support in English, ask for help in the [r/Jailbreak Discord server](https://discord.gg/jb).

## Shadow

## FlyJB & FlyJB X

?> These bypasses were developed by XsF1re, but he has taken down his repo and they are no longer maintained. We recommend you use [A-Bypass](#A-Bypass) or another kernel level bypass.
