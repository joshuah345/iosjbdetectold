# App List

?> Some apps (such as ones developed by Niantic and Nintendo) are updated frequently to patch their jailbreak detection. Some bypasses may need updates and or workarounds for these apps to function.

?> Unless specified otherwise, if there are multiple bypasses listed, use **one** of them at a time.

?> If you'd like to contribute to the list, open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/joshuah345/joshuah345.github.io/issues/new?assignees=&labels=request&template=request.yml&title=%5BRequest%5D%3A+)
