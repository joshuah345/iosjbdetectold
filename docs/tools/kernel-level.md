!> vnodebypass will disable tweaks globally as well as hide many crucial jailbreak-related files. Make sure to disable vnodebypass once you're finished using the app you're attempting to bypass.

> Users on unc0ver (iOS 14.4+) must also install Siguza's `libkrw` from Elucubratus, else vnodebypass will fail to enable. If enabling still fails, reinstall libkrw.

1. After installation, an app will appear on your homescreen named `vnodebypass`. 
2. Launch it and press the enable button.
