# Tweaks
These tools attempt to circumvent detection methods.

!> Do not attempt to use multiple bypasses at once. It will result in conflicts and apps are very likely to crash if you do.

1. Launch Settings
2. Locate the prefs for A-Bypass
3. Enable the tweak
4. Press `Check For Updates`
5. Scroll down and toggle the switch beside the app(s) to bypass.

> Relating to the above note: A-Bypass will notfy you if you have another bypass enabled, or if A-Bypass cannot inject itself into the app you enabled and launched.
