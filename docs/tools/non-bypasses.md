# Non-bypasses
These tools are used for disabling and configuring tweak injection into processes.

## Choicy

> If you're using a jailbreak with Coolstar's libhooker, please use [libhooker-configurator](#-libhooker-configurator) as its functions have been implemented into it.

?> Available from [opa334's repo](https://opa334.github.io/).

1. Launch Settings
2. Locate the prefs for Choicy
3. Tap on Applications
4. Choose the Application with jailbreak detection.
  - For Snapchat, Clash Of Clans (as well as a few other apps), toggle `Disable Tweak Injection` instead and skip the next steps.

For apps that don't respond well to tweak injection, yet have bypasses, complete the steps above, then:
1. Toggle `Custom Tweak Configuration`
2. Change the mode to `Allow`
3. Toggle the switch for the bypass you're using.



## Libhooker Configurator

!> libhooker-configurator is only available for Procursus-based jailbreaks. eg: Taurine/Odyssey(ra1n). If you use a Substrate or Substitute based jailbreak, such as checkra1n or unc0ver, use Choicy instead.

1. Open the `libhooker` application
2. Continue from Choicy's 3rd step.
